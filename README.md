# Repository for CSC-256 assignments
I made this repository for a class assignment and it demonstrates how to use markdown and commit changes to the main branch. It will probably be used for future assignments, which will help me expand my knowledge of Git Hub.

## Coding experience 
I am still learning a lot about computer programming. I completed python programming last semester and found it a little challenging, but after much practice, I became more proficient. I also took a class for javascript and it was fun to learn about the process of creating websites. Programming is a skill that I am still improving on and hopefully, I can make a career out of it.

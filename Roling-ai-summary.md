## Key Findings

### 1. Source 1: [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-in-software-development#:~:text=AI%20detects%20bugs%2C%20vulnerabilities%20and,the%20reliability%20of%20the%20software.)
- **Summary**: Many companies in software develpoment have employed the use of AI. This can affect software developers postivitly with the autocompletion of code, code generation, and testing automation, but it can also negativily impact the work environment. These risks can include the overreliance on AI, job displacement, and security risks. Even though AI is rapidly advancing I believe it is still benefical to have developers to verify that the information is correct.
- **Key Takeaways**:
  - AI can be benefitical
  - Puts less stress on the developers 
  - Possiblity of replacing jobs in the programming field

- **Summary**: Quality Assurance is important in programming because it verifies that the work is correct. AI excels with QA because of its ability to "identify patterns, trends, and correlations", which can save a lot of time for software developers. AI also utilizes algorithms to see what parts of code needs to be addressed. The automation of these tasks "helps manual testers insure they have the neccessary infrastructure and rescources to conduct testing". This essientaily makes the programmers job significantly eaiser. 
- **Key Takeaways**:
  - AI detects any errors in code
  - A useful tool for programmers
  - Saves a lot of time

- **Summary**: There are many predictions for the future of AI in software development. Some active trends are automated testing/debugging and code generation, but within time there will be an endless amount of uses for AI. Mr. Cetin believes some future trends could include user optiminaztion, repairing code automatically, and predicting timelines for projects. I can see this becoming a reality within a few years or even sooner, since technology is rapidly evolving.
- **Key Takeaways**:
  - The future of progamming may be in the hands of AI
  - Possibilty for automated code creation
  - AI may have an endless supply of tools

## Conclusion
Overall, AI will most likely become mandatory in computer programming because of its ease of use, adapability, and super fast testing of code. I find it very interesting that AI is slowly becoming a useful tool for programming and other fields, but I'm also weary because it may have the potential to replace the jobs of many computer progammers.

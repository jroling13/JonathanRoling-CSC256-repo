## Key Findings

### 1. Source 1: [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-in-software-development#:~:text=AI%20detects%20bugs%2C%20vulnerabilities%20and,the%20reliability%20of%20the%20software.)
- **Summary**: Many companies in software develpoment have employed the use of AI. This can affect software developers postivitly with the autocompletion of code, code generation, and testing automation, but it can also negativily impact the work environment. These risks can include the overreliance on AI, job displacement, and security risks. Even though AI is rapidly advancing I believe it is still benefical to have developers to verify that the information is correct.
- **Key Takeaways**:
  - AI can be benefitical
  - Puts less stress on the developers 
  - Possiblity of replacing jobs in the programming field

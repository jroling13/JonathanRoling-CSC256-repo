## Key Findings

### 1. Source 1: [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-in-software-development#:~:text=AI%20detects%20bugs%2C%20vulnerabilities%20and,the%20reliability%20of%20the%20software.)
- **Summary**: Many software development companies have employed AI. This can affect software developers positively with the autocompletion of code, code generation, and testing automation, but it can also negatively impact the work environment. These risks can include the overreliance on AI, job displacement, and security risks. Even though AI is rapidly advancing I believe it is still beneficial to have developers verify that the information is correct.
- **Key Takeaways**:
  - AI can be beneficial
  - Puts less stress on the developers 
  - Possibility of replacing jobs in the programming field

- **Summary**: Quality Assurance is important in programming because it verifies that the work is correct. AI excels with QA because of its ability to "identify patterns, trends, and correlations", which can save a lot of time for software developers. AI also utilizes algorithms to see what parts of code need to be addressed. The automation of these tasks "helps manual testers insure they have the necessary infrastructure and resources to conduct testing". This essentially makes the programmer's job significantly easier. 
- **Key Takeaways**:
  - AI detects any errors in code
  - A useful tool for programmers
  - Saves a lot of time

- **Summary**: There are many predictions for the future of AI in software development. Some active trends are automated testing/debugging and code generation, but over time there will be an endless amount of uses for AI. Mr. Cetin believes some future trends could include user optimization, repairing code automatically, and predicting timelines for projects. I can see this becoming a reality within a few years or even sooner, since technology is rapidly evolving.
- **Key Takeaways**:
  - The future of programming may be in the hands of AI
  - Possibility for automated code creation
  - AI may have an endless supply of tools

## Conclusion
Overall, AI will most likely become mandatory in computer programming because of its ease of use, adaptability, and super fast testing of code. I find it very interesting that AI is slowly becoming a useful tool for programming and other fields, but I'm also weary because it may have the potential to replace the jobs of many computer programmers.
